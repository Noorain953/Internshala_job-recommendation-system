# Job Recommendation Logic

## Overview

This document explains how the job recommendation system matches users with job postings based on their skills, experience level, and preferences.

### Matching Algorithm

1. **Skills Matching**:
   The algorithm checks if the user's skills overlap with the required skills of the job posting. Jobs that require at least one skill that the user possesses are considered for recommendation.

2. **Experience Level Matching**:
   The user's experience level is matched with the job posting's experience requirements. For example, if a job requires an "Intermediate" experience level, users with that experience level will be prioritized.

3. **Location & Job Type Preferences**:
   The user's location preferences (remote or specific city) are matched with the job location in the job posting. Additionally, the job type (Full-Time, Part-Time, Contract) must also match the user's preference.

4. **Scoring Mechanism**:
   For simplicity, this system uses basic filtering. However, this can be extended to a more complex scoring system, where jobs with the most skills matched and closest location preferences would get higher priority.

### Challenges

- **Overlapping Skills**: Since many jobs require multiple skills, a simple overlap may match too many jobs. A more advanced approach could assign weights based on the number of matching skills.
- **User Preferences**: Some user preferences might conflict (e.g., multiple desired locations), requiring additional decision-making logic.
- **Database Optimization**: As the dataset grows, querying performance may degrade. Adding indexing to fields like `skills` and `location` can improve performance.
